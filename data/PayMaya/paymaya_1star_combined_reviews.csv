It seems that the developer is quite lazy when he created this app. Also the worst part, in upgrade process even though i entered that my income comes from remittance it still ask for the nature of my work which doest make any sense because I dont work. So i tried to enter ‚ÄòNature of work‚Äô but guess what when i tap it for the list of nature of work it doest list any thing but a blank page.

This App has a much more stable credit card gateway and payment gateway. All web payment transactions using virtual work seamlessly almost everywhere. You can even link PayMaya to your Apple ID. Coolest integration so far. 

But why 1 star? For this app. 

First, I‚Äôd say The app developers need to really focus on a CICD app strategy...completely lacking fresh periodic updates. 

It appears as if a Proper Functional test cases for each service seem missing from this app strategy. An easy one For example, after transferring money from your bank account into PayMaya, it still relies on Javascript redirect before you are brought back to the main menu. That‚Äôs so early 2000‚Äôs programming.. Otherwise 9/10 times you find yourself confusingly backtracking to the main menu by clicking ‚Äúback‚Äù button.

That was until I received a text message that my virtual card was deactivated because I haven‚Äôt used it for 30 days, which is not true because I did my groceries just a few days before. Opened the app and saw that I was supposed to upgrade my account. I tried to do so but it requires specific types of IDs which I currently don‚Äôt have and am unable to get due to the lockdown. I emailed customer service why my account was deactivated in the first place and if they can give me an exception for the ID due to the situation. I got a response that my card expired, which again is not true because I remember using my card for purchase and the expiry date is not anytime soon. After explaining that in my response, I did not hear back from them for about 3 weeks now. This is such an inconvenience at such a critical time.

Not long after, at 1:00 AM of dec 24, I received a text informing me the approval of 1K payment to Lazada. I immediately calledup customer service reporting that I didn‚Äôt make the purchase. The person said I should complain to lazada. Why should i do that. PayMaya should verify if indeed it was me who made that purchase before approval of payment not after approval was made. Later on, I wrote to PayMaya but more than 3 months passed but I never received a reply. 
The damn hacker from time to time tried to purchase using my card and I received text messages that there is not enough balance to pay.
I just remember to write here so others would be aware that things like these happened. And yes, I don‚Äôt recommend PayMaya to others based on my experience. 
Ha ha, I could not send this within rating, so I am forced to check one star!!!!

Today is May 29, 2020

Please be informed I received the following notifications that payment could not be made because of insufficient balance:
- May 29 to POSTMATES
- May 23 & May 5 to GLOBE WEBLOADING EC
- April 25 to IHERB and CARNSORE BROADBAND LTD 
- TWO unsuccessful charges in Feb

However, until now I cannot tranfer my virtual money to my ATM since it requires upgrade of account.

However there seems to be no response after the 48hrs waiting. I get tired and decided not to go the process again and just use the money for purchasing or payment. Now here comes the payment bills particularly Globe. There are 2 options in the ""Biller"" that is Globe Broadband and Globe Telecom. I tap on Globe broadband since its paying for my internet bill. I cannot go through the process since paymaya only allowed Account Numbers that starts with ""1, 6 or 0"" only. My account number with Globe starts with ""9"". I don't know if this is with PayMaya app faulty configuration or with Globes'. I already contacted thru message the Globe.

This is weird since I only have one place of birth and I‚Äôm 100% sure I did not change it since I only submitted my information for the account upgrade once. Told the CS that I used the same information with my previous calls and got verified. I pointed out to the CS that maybe she is not looking at the correct information for my place of birth or there is a glitch in the database or system but insisted that I‚Äôm wrong. I cannot even see anymore in the app all my other personal information other than my name and mobile number. And she asked me to call back once I remember my correct place of birth. Really? How come I‚Äôm able to verify my account with my previous calls with the same information and then today I was told after providing the same place of birth that it is incorrect. This is not making any sense to me and I‚Äôm hoping PayMaya will look into this asap. Very poor customer service! üòî,1,app store,2020-08-01 00:00:00

It is not advisable for you to put a huge amount of money, and withdrawing it in the future, because surely, you will be having a real struggle if your account is not upgraded. There's a lot of restrictions, which includes (you can‚Äôt do money/bank transfer other than sending your money through a smart padala agent with 16 digit receiver‚Äôs account number, other than that, you can‚Äôt withdraw your cash from your account)
I tried to upgrade our account last Friday, but up until now, it is already Wednesday morning, I still haven‚Äôt receive any updates about my upgrade status.

Rooms for improvement
-add more options for valid ids
-put more people to handle upgrade validation to secure that UPGRADE  SHOULD REALLY BE WITHIN 72 HOURS and not 72 DAYS.

2021-02-23 10:19:10,Wow! What a robotic response. The comment is there! Read it! Load system could be simpler like in GCash. I love the fact that we can buy SteamWallet. But again. Interface could be simpler. Like in GCash or when you cash in. You enter a valid amount instead of scrolling all through the sea of options you have. The promos also is convoluted and you dont know if its still active or not. There should be a separate tab for discounts/promos etc. Instead of poping the screen with ads.,1,play store,2021-02-01 00:00:00
