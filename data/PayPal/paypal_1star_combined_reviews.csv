Unfortunately, i dont have one accept for my birth certificate and my school ID. Still not accept it. I chose to refund the money back to sender so i can use another way but they decided to took out money from my bank account ""ON HOLD"" of $2500 and left me with a negative balance and over draft. Also, the money transferred back to sender were less than they sent because of different in currency and that is a biggest BS to me/ Like if you not gonna let me accept my money then why send the same amount of USD back to sender with less than how much VND they sent over? Do yall eat that $200? Yes,$200. If it was $10-20 we dont care, even $100 we dont care. But now I am down $200 from money refund, $35 for bank over draft? LIKE BRO, GET YOUR S TOGETHER.... Messages them multiple time about it and no replies, called hotline and was put on a 7 hours+ wait, and yet your collection agent are straight to connect?

If you saved then just hope like hell that you don't suffer Financial fraud because if you authorise one seller to collect payments this app will allow that seller to draw payments (through frauds) with out the need of OTPs/ Pins/ passwords.

You can start a case because of getting ripped off because of counterfeit products and the seller just tries to get more money from you but PayPal closes any communication so you have to take the bad deal or the worst deal.

This problem occurs even with friends you have already sent money to: You can't verify the eMail address (which may have changed) of someone in your contact list. As a result, the contact list IS USELESS in many cases!!! You can't even edit the name in the contact list to help distinguish similar or ambiguous names.

To clarify, I have been trying for over 2 weeks to get in touch with actual people in this company's customer service department. As soon as one of them picks up, they make well damn sure to refuse you for various reasons. And I have all my emails, I know all my phone numbers even though I don't own my old one anymore and can provide any proof to them - they would only need to actually want to help out. But they don't. They simply pass you on to the next person, then to the next phone number(!!) until there's literally no one else at the end of that line. It took me well over 2 weeks of being made a fool by this thieving company only to realize that I should just give up, retain the little bits of dignity I have left and let them walk away with my money. And yes, I would recommend this joke-of-a-service to my enemies and the paypal CEO. Ok, ok. One last fun read. IF you call the customer service number provided INSIDE the app which you logged into from you phone, they ^&*# you up by calling to ANOTHER country, where after a long, arduous call and identification process, they finally tell you: you bloke, you can't call us for any issues on this phone number, because it is not the phone number of your registered phone's country... ... .... .. really paypal? I mean, really? How could you do this? It can only be on purpose guys. That's what I think. A stupid bunch of people couldn't think this up for their lives, it's so evil. I switched to Revolut today.

We have recently launched an online business through Shopify and had integrated PayPal into our store as a credit card processor. Of our first dozen orders, 7 chose PayPal to process and due to their ""security processing"", all 7 of our orders were held up for a minimum of 5 days and we have 1 of them that has now been held 20 days. I have spoken to PayPal 2 times and get the same story from the reps - this is our security procedures to protect you. Shopify payments process through in 24 hours and we feel quite protected. After they have held onto our payment for this long, then they ask for another 1% to release funds immediately. My most transaction released was for approximately $150. The order came in on 4/26, just got released today, May 5th. I tried to transfer to our bank and I was informed they were going to hold onto this up to another 72 hours. I can't believe any small business can operate with their payment processor holding onto cash for up to 21 days.",1,play store,2021-05-01 00:00:00

But neither there is confirmation for accepting it nor funds are deposited in my 'PayPal' account. I kindly and genuinely reported this problem to 'PayPal' but there is no response instead got a kind blackmail that the payment will be returned to the 'Clickworker' after 10th July.
