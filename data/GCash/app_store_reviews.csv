i don't usually rate/review,"This app gets so many negative reviews but it‚Äôs actually not that bad. It‚Äôs really made things more convenient. I get to avoid long lines especially in banks, since you can deposit using this app. You just have to go cash in through machines and other partner establishments which have no lines usually. It has also been a great help during the quarantine. Also there‚Äôs no convenience fee when paying bills when using their service unlike other apps where they charge you for it. I did encounter times where deductions to my fund were made despite transactions failing but i contacted customer service and filed a form and was refunded (just provide proof and you‚Äôre good). There was also one time where I cashed in to a wrong account (I typed a wrong number) with 15k and called the customer service and they were able to transfer it back to my correct account (again just provide proof like transaction numbers and receipts and you‚Äôre good). Yeah those took some time but it‚Äôs typical in our country to have slow processing when it comes to these things so it was understandable.

Kyo V,"I've been using gcash for 2 years now, and yes it's not perfect, but it has helped me a lot in managing my finances, especially now that there's a pandemic and you just can't go out whenever you want to. It made transfers between different banks easier. I'm able to pay my bills at home. Connecting my bank account to gcash and cashing in and out happens real time. Although I've encountered some issues like unsuccessful transaction and yet money is deducted from my account, or errors in paying bills I'm usually paying every month, I still believe these are just minor lapses which Gcash will be able to address (in my case, money deducted was returned, and I'm able to pay the bill by retrying several times). Not to mention Gsave (partnered with CIMB) which has a 4.1% per annum interest rate, which is WAAAAY above what banks offer.

So as a summary, I still believe Gcash is a great app to use. Go ahead and download it!",False,Gcash user since 2018,5,2020-06-07 04:57:17,

Pinaganda lang UI pero pinasakit ulo mo. Ngayon pinag iisipan ko nang ilipat yung GSave funds ko sa iba. Yung hassle na binibigay sayo ng app na to sobrang nakaka stress na dapat eh simple lang sana which is yun ang purpose nila. 

Since 2018 my main source of incoming funds ay thru PayPal. Sobrang dali noon. Walang hassle. Thankful ako sa GCash. But last month, hindi na ako makapag cash in sa PayPal. Puro error na lang yung App. Lahat ng trouble shootings ginawa ko na. Lahat ng suggestions ng GCash Support walang kwenta dahil hindi naman na resolve yung issue. Asked customer service ng PayPal. Wala naman daw problema account ko. So ano na? Weeks pasts wala pa rin talaga.

So I decided na mag cash in using my bank accounts. Okay naman nung una pero may mga kailngan akong transaction using bank transfer sa GCash at ngayon hindi makapag proceed. May error na naman like limits etc. for the limit, I cash in small amount and have to transfer it to my parent para may pang gastos at pambili ng makakakain. Convenient sana kase easy transfer na, lockdown pa naman.

aaarkeyy,"Thought this was a great app until I had these issues:
1. PayQR has become scary as the confirmation sms would take time thus you will have to wait for several minutes up to an hour just to complete the transaction because there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôd want to pay again in cash when your gcash money has been deducted already. Now I don‚Äôt trust this app for payment anymore as I‚Äôm scared I would be in a rush and then have this encounter. That would be such a shame when the entire point of using this feature is because of the fast transaction.
2. Buy Load is always unavailable. Sometimes I need to buy load right away but I couldn‚Äôt because that feature is not available. Also, there‚Äôs this GoExtra90 something (not really sure of the name) that promises a 50 pesos voucher but when you try to claim it you would always get an error. I mean for what I‚Äôm paying I think the voucher is really excessive as a benefit but if the customer cannot claim it that‚Äôs false advertising and it shouldn‚Äôt be up in the promo description. Not really mad that I cannot claim it but would just want to say it shouldn‚Äôt be included in there if it really isn‚Äôt available.
3. They say you can pay Netflix through Gcash AMEX but when I try to set it up Netflix doesn‚Äôt accept it. When I contacted them they said my AMEX is not valid then I reached out to Gcash and the rep told me there should be no problem with it. When I tried to ask for how I can fix it I got no more response and I just told myself to wait but then it took ten more minutes so I just gave up. Now I don‚Äôt even know which one of them is saying the correct thing.

myja r.,"If there is a rating with 0 stars, I would have given it. This app is worthless. They offer too may side services like investments, savings and charity donation tools but they can‚Äôt even fix the most basic feature of being able to cash in conveniently. How can we avail other services within this app if we can‚Äôt put in our money first? 

I am a fully verified user but eversince I installed this app, I‚Äôm unable to link my gcash to any bank account and or even cash in with other online options like using paypal or my credit/debit card. This app always has too many technical issues to begin with. Also, since I can‚Äôt link it with any bank account, withdrawing money from here is a challenge as well. And yes, you have the option of simply going to convenience stores to put money in your gcash too but it defeats the purpose of having the app. Why bother installing this when you can‚Äôt settle your basic matters through a touch of a finger?

The worst part is that the live support is totally useless and will keep asking the same questions and details that are unrelated to the issue you reported. After days of going in circles, I totally gave up talking to them. Also, I wouldn‚Äôt trust a service wherein several different staff will keep on asking for my bank account details. This is very unsecure and could impose potential privacy and security issues to the user.

If you have the guts to spill your private info and have no fear of potentially losing money, then be my guest and keep using this service, otherwise, don‚Äôt waste your time installing this app. Find another company that has a more reputable and stable cash in service.",False,Don‚Äôt trust your money with them,1,2020-01-04 12:59:40,

I am just wondering why you guys are keep on running this app if the service is not working most of the times. Yesterday i tried to add money to my acct, went to several partners u guys have and i ended up sending the money through them instead using my app for me to save some money. However as a customer u cant do anything but to keep on murmuring how bad the app is.. it shows here in the application that we can get money over the counter through tour partners. i tried that a lot of times and keep on asking is to why they cant process it.. they will just answer me that its with GCASH on their end ur app does kot works fine and most of the time its offline..GCASH why are u doing this things to ur customers? Dont u think its a waste of time for us?? How come ur able to keep this app working and u guys doesnt even care if were able to use it or not. Tried calling a lot of times and i dont get answers from ur agents.. some of ur agents are nit familiar with the options that u guys have. Have them trained pls,,!! Now going to my issue. Now it says here under borrow load that i can borrow load and ill be deducted as soon as ill add money to my gcash acct.. now that option is still there but it does not allow me to borrow the load.. its important for me coz as of this time i need to get in touch with my family and i cant go outside to buy load coz of the curfew.i cant do it coz the community is under quarantine.. now i dont see that u guys are being helpful to us people.. pretty much i will make sure that ill report ur app and give u bad ratings and provide u comments that can awaken ur sense for u guys to check on the app itself..

PLEASE BE AWARE OF GCash!!!!! THEY ARE GODDAMN THIEVES!!! SOBRA NA TALAGA!! 

ONCE IS ENOUGH!! TWICE IS FUCKING TOO MUCH!!

I cashed in the 10,300php from BDO. I cashed in the 4,920php from Security Bank.

Last April 3, I Cashed In 10,300php through my linked Debit Card ( BDO ) but it did not reflect sa Gcash yet  na sa account ko. I received a text saying it cannot be processed at the moment. So I waited 24 hours hoping magreflect pero wala talaga. 

I contacted Gcash Support and was told na it is unsuccessful on their end so there's nothing they can do about it. So I contacted BDO, I was advised that it is successful and I should contact Gcash to have it credited.

I contacted Gcash again and they told me the same thing which is it is unsuccessful. I told them what BDO told me and they said they will escalate it. Since then, araw araw ako natawag for an update pero laging wala hanggang sa mapagod na ako.

After 17 days of waiting, they sent me an email telling me it is really unsuccessful and I should coordinate with BDO. They said they will provide me a Formal Letter certifying that it is unsuccessful to provide sa Bank.

I submitted a dispute sa BDO but it was declined due to lack of supporting documents. Since then wala pa din yung Formal Letter na need ko. Araw araw nagsesend ako ng email. Formal letter nalang hindi pa maibigay!! 10,300php is not a joke!!

Since then, nakakapag Cash In ako ng mga small amounts para sa load. All those transactions walang issue. 

Now, I cashed in again amounting 4920php through linked Debit Card ( SecurityBank ). I got an error yet the money has been taken out of my SB account. For the second time!!! 

So pag small amounts, no issues. Pag malaking amounts, nagdidisappear!!! 

HINDI PA AKO NAKAKA MOVE ON SA 10k!! Fresh na fresh pa sa utak ko mga hayup na to!! 

NAKUKUHA NYO PA MAGNAKAW SA CRISIS NGAYON!! 

Hindi ako nagsalita or nagpost nung sa 10k at hinayaan ko. Pero maulit nanaman?! Dyusko!! 

And THEY HAVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!! LAGI IDIDISCONNECT CALL MO!

another_app-user,"I cash in to my account and it was easily credited to my gcash account.

fli.pj,"I thought that using this app is seamless and hassle-free, but I guess I was wrong. I cashed in for 1,100.00, and then my bank account was deducted, however I got a message from Gcash saying that my cash in was unsuccessful. I talked to your customer service rep last Monday for assistance, said that they have verified the transaction, and assured that the money will get posted to my Gcash account. Turns out that you aren‚Äôt capable of doing that, since I just got an email today saying that the transaction was unsuccessful on your end, and I need to contact my bank for assistance. I ended up wasting time talking to your clueless and inexperienced customer service representatives, and now I would need to contact my bank to try and reverse the transaction which would drag on for another 3-5 banking days. I will uninstall the app once I get my money back, and go back to Paymaya since they aren‚Äôt that bad compared to Gcash.
